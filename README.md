#Breakout Game

Another fun windows form game that I have created in C#. Breakout is a classic and it was eye opening to see how it was made. I enjoyed creating this application and can't wait to add more to it. 

To control the platform, you simply press the left and right directional keys. The objective is to bounce the ball towards the bricks above and break them all! 

Future Updates:
1) Reset button
2) Stylized message for the winner
